# Syllabus: Introduction to Computational Social Science

## Course Description
This course introduces students to the field of Computational Social Science, an interdisciplinary area combining techniques from computer science, statistics, and social science to analyze social phenomena. The course covers key methods, including data collection, analysis, and modeling of social data, using tools Python and R. By the end, students will be equipped with the skills to conduct their own research using computational methods.

## Course Objectives
1. Understand the foundations and scope of computational social science.
2. Learn techniques for collecting, processing, and analyzing data.
3. Develop proficiency in computational tools and statistical methods.
4. Apply computational methods to study and model social phenomena.
5. Critically evaluate computational social science research.
